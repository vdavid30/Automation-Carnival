# Automation-Carnival

## Automated testing framework for the Carnival Web Page
### Covered user stories

[Carnival Web Page](http://www.carnival.com)
* As a user I want to search cruises to The Bahamas with duration
  between 6 and 9 days so that I will visualize all the options to choose
  one. Right now, I donâ€™t care about departure port.
* As a user I want to choose one sail and learn more about the trip, so
  that I will get more info about itinerary
